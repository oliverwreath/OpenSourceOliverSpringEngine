# Oliver Spring Engine -  KickStart your project in 10 mins
* lets you focus on the money-making business logic with a default payment button and user login infrastructure from day 1. 

Welcome! I always dream of a Spring Boot Engine to kick-start projects since they really share a lot of commons. 

# Quick Configurations: 
* 1 rename src/main/resources/application-dev.properties.bak TO application-dev.properties

* 2 Then change the following: 
spring.datasource.username=YOUR_DB_INSTANCE_USERNAME
spring.datasource.password=YOUR_DB_INSTANCE_PASSWORD
oliver.jpa.properties.hibernate.hostname=YOUR_DB_INSTANCE_HOSTNAME

# Quick Test: 
* 1 Then Run Your Tests right away to make sure everything adapts comfortably.
